            <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, creating a seamless and user-friendly experience is paramount. One often-overlooked aspect is the humble textarea element, where users input various forms of text. Traditional textareas have a fixed size, leading to a less-than-optimal user experience when dealing with varying amounts of content. In this blog post, we'll explore a simple yet effective technique known as "AutoGrow Textareas" using CSS to dynamically adjust the textarea size based on user input.</p>
            <p><h4>CSS Styling for AutoGrow Textareas:</h4></p>
            <ul>
            <li><p><b>Disabling Default Resizing:</b>
                To initiate the AutoGrow effect, we start by disabling the default resizing handle that appears in the bottom-right corner of textareas. This ensures that users can't manually resize the textarea, maintaining a clean and controlled interface.</p>
            <img src="textarea1.png" alt=""></li>
            <li><p><b>Initial Overflow Setting:</b></p>
            <p>We initially set the overflow-y property to 'hidden' to hide the vertical scrollbar. This prevents any distractions for users when the textarea is not actively expanding.</p>
            <img src="textarea2.png" alt=""></li>
            <li><p><b>Dynamic Height Adjustment:</b></p>
            <p>We leverage the height property to allow the browser to automatically adjust the textarea's height based on the content. Additionally, we set a minimum height to ensure the textarea doesn't collapse to nothing when empty.</p>
            <img src="textarea3.png" alt=""></li>
            <li><p>As the demands of the web change and developers experiment with different user experiences, the need for more native language improvements expands. Our presentation layer, CSS, has done incredibly well in improving capabilities, even if sometimes too slow. The need for native support for automatically expanding textarea elements has been long known...and it's finally here!</p>
            <p><h4>To allow textarea elements to grow vertically and horizontally, add the field-sizing property with a value of content:</h4></p>
            <img src="autocorrect .png" alt="" style="width: 750px;"></li>
            <p>The default value for field-sizing is fixed, signaling current behavior. The new behavior, content, will expand as much as possible. To constrain the size a textarea can grow, use traditional width/max-width and height/max-height properties.</p>
            <p>It’s important to follow trends in your field to ensure you’re staying current on standards and protocols and perhaps more so in the field of coding.

                Programmers of all specialties can benefit from following industry-leading blogs to stay aware of the latest technologies.</p>
            <p>How is it possible that JavaScript-based animation has secretly always been as fast — or faster — than CSS transitions? And, how is it possible that Adobe and Google consistently release media-rich mobile sites that rival the performance of native apps?

            <p>This article serves as a point-by-point walkthrough of how JavaScript-based DOM animation libraries, such as Velocity.js and GSAP, are more performant than jQuery and CSS-based animation libraries.</p>
